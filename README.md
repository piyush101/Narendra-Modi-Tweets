# Narendra-Modi-Tweets

Here I scraped all the tweets of Mr. Narendra Modi since he became India's 14th Prime Minister. I use Selenium and Beautiful Soup to scrape tweets. There is another approach which is using Twitter API but it only scrapes 3200 tweets. So, here I use Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape all the tweets with Twitter Advanced Search option.

After scraping, I create features so, as to analyse his tweets.
So, for this I first need text cleaning,than creating more features like mostly used word,most used hashtag,most tag, total number of language, frequency of tweets on average day and at election time,etc


Here modi.csv contains the whole tweets dataset. It contains various features like tweets, languages and many more.

features_modi.ipynb contains features so, as to analyse his tweets.
